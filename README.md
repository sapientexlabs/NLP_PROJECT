# NLP_PROJECT
## Fake News Detection with NLP
## Overview
This project aims to tackle the pervasive issue of fake news in the digital age by applying advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. By analyzing the 'Fake and Real News' dataset from Kaggle, we develop a machine learning model capable of distinguishing between real and fabricated news articles with high accuracy. This endeavor not only contributes to academic research in the field of NLP but also offers practical solutions for social media platforms seeking to curb the spread of misinformation.

## Objectives
To conduct a thorough analysis of the fake and real news dataset to understand the characteristics distinguishing genuine news from false ones.
To apply advanced text preprocessing techniques for optimal data preparation and feature extraction.
To implement nested cross-validation to ensure model robustness and to avoid overfitting.
To fine-tune prediction models for better accuracy in classifying news articles as real or fake.
## Dataset
The dataset, available on the Kaggle official website, consists of two CSV files containing real and fake news articles, with a total of 44,898 entries. It includes information such as article titles, text, subjects, publishing dates, and labels indicating the truthfulness of the article.

## Methodology
Data Preparation and Cleaning: Merging datasets, shuffling data to prevent bias, and preprocessing text to remove unwanted characters and stopwords.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing data to extract meaningful insights and patterns that aid in model development.
Model Development: Utilizing machine learning algorithms like Multinomial Naive-Bayes, k-Nearest Neighbor, and Random Forest Classification to develop predictive models.
Model Evaluation: Applying nested cross-validation to assess model performance and ensure integrity in prediction results.
Tools and Technologies
Programming Language: Python
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Techniques: Text preprocessing, Tokenization, Machine Learning, Nested Cross-Validation
## Results
The project successfully developed a model that can predict the authenticity of news articles with a 95% accuracy rate, significantly surpassing the performance of benchmark models. This highlights the effectiveness of the selected NLP techniques and machine learning algorithms in tackling fake news detection.
